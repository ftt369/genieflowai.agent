# Database Setup Summary

## Current Status

We've been working on setting up the Supabase database for your application. Here's the current status:

1. **Connection to Supabase**: 
   - The connection to Supabase is partially working
   - The anon key is valid and can connect to the API
   - The service role key appears to be invalid or expired

2. **Database Tables**: 
   - The required tables (`subscription_plans`, `prompts`, `profiles`) do not exist yet
   - We've prepared SQL statements to create these tables

3. **Seeding Data**:
   - The subscription plans seeding script is ready but cannot run until tables are created

## Next Steps

Please follow these steps to complete the database setup:

1. **Create the database tables manually**:
   - Follow the instructions in [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](./SUPABASE_SETUP.md)
   - Use the SQL statements provided to create the tables in the Supabase SQL editor

2. **Seed the subscription plans**:
   - After creating the tables, run: `npm run db:simple-seed`

3. **Check your Supabase credentials (optional)**: 
   - If you want to use the service role key for admin operations
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard > Settings > API
   - Copy the new service role key and update your `.env.local` file

## Verification

After completing the setup, you can verify your database is working by running:

```
npm run db:test-connection
```

You should see successful connections and no table-related errors.
